Why Fandoms Matter in Marketing: A Guide for Brands

Today, especially online, there’s a lot of buzz around fandoms. These passionate groups of fans are becoming increasingly important to marketers, but why?

We all know what it’s like to be a fan. Whether it’s a celebrity, movie, TV show, or football team, we’ve all found something we don’t just like—we love. But even now, there’s still a tendency to associate fans with the word “fanatic,” which carries negative connotations.

However, being a fan doesn’t mean being obsessed or irrational. Most fans are engaged, positive, and proactive supporters of what they love.

Fans are the ones who proudly wear team jerseys, spend extra money on special Blu-ray editions, and camp out for concert tickets. They don’t just like something—they actively show their support, both personally and financially.

Let’s be real for a second: How many casual consumers (who aren’t influencers) do you see passionately creating and sharing content for brands or products? Not many. The people driving trends and making posts go viral are the dedicated fans, the ones constantly checking socials for new updates, likes, and dislikes. They’re the trendsetters.

See why they’re so valuable? Engaging fandoms not only gives you loyal promoters, but also enthusiastic consumers who will make sure your marketing material gets shared far and wide.

So how can you cultivate your own fandom? Here are three tips:

1. Find Your Niche of Fanatics
First off, don’t get weird. No one’s going to build a fandom for a baby brand with edgy memes and deep-fried humor. You need to research your niche carefully and find the right communities to tap into.

Take the baby brand example—target niches like breastfeeding moms, gentle parenting advocates, or alternative parenting groups. Research the most vocal online communities that align with your brand’s values, and you’ll find your people.

2. Create Content with Value
In the age of ad overload, traditional ads have lost their impact, especially with Gen Z and Millennials. What’s the solution? Make ads that are more than just ads. This is a core principle of Frictionless Marketing.

Think about it—would you scroll past a fun and interesting ad if it showed up in your feed as more then just an ad, but actual content? If you’re too close to the brand, try showing it to a friend for feedback. Aim to entertain, not just promote.

3. Speak Their Language
If you’re B2B, this is different, but if you’re talking to people, speak their language. Why are you writing like you’re drafting a thesis? Speak internet, queen.

For example, let’s say you’re marketing for a game studio. Scroll through other game dev accounts, and you’ll see phrases like “beta game,” “alpha release,” “crunch time,” “debugging,” and so on. Learn the lingo, and you’ll become part of the community, eventually pulling them into your own.

4. Listen to Your Fandom
As your community grows, they’ll start giving you feedback—sometimes even without realizing it. They might not be marketing experts (unless that’s your niche), but they know what they want. Don’t follow them blindly, but take the time to understand their needs and values.

Pay attention to what they post and share. What’s important to them? The answers will guide you in creating content that resonates.

This was just a taste of how fandoms and Frictionless Marketing can benefit your brand. Want more? Shout us out on socials!
